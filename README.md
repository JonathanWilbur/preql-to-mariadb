## What is PreQL?

A Pre-SQL language that can transpile to any SQL dialect. It takes a declarative
Kubernetes-like YAML schema and generates the necessary commands or statements
in the correct order to generate schema and other database objects in the
database dialect of your choice.

## What is this Library

This library converts PreQL into MariaDB SQL.
